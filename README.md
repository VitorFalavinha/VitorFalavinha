Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor Falavinha,

Iâ€™m a curious human being, interested in technology, communication, and art.
At the moment I am learning about programming and algorithms. I've got basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python knowledge. 
Iâ€™m looking foward to collaborating on the development and improvement of Web Systems.
